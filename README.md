# Approov Backend Quickstart - Java Spring

This project provides a server-side example of Approov token verification for a protected backend API. It exposes a simple API that verifies Approov tokens before granting access to protected endpoints and demonstrates how the endpoints behave under the current Approov configuration:

 - `/unprotected` - no Approov token required.
 - `/token-check` - requires a valid Approov token.
 - `/token-binding` - requires a valid Approov token which is bound to a header value.
 - `/token-double-binding` - requires a valid Approov token which is bound to two header values.

In this example, Approov protection is implemented by the [ApproovTokenVerifier](https://github.com/KMilej/quickstart-java-spring/blob/main/src/main/java/io/approov/ApproovApplication.java#L225-L353), which validates the Approov token (signature + expiry) and enforces token binding where required. The filter is wired into Spring Security in the [SecurityConfig](https://github.com/KMilej/quickstart-java-spring/blob/main/src/main/java/io/approov/ApproovApplication.java#L188-L219).

## Approov Token Verification Flow

1. **Token Request:**  
   The Approov SDK inside the mobile app securely communicates with the Approov Cloud Service to obtain a short-lived [Approov Token](https://ext.approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#approov-tokens) (a signed JWT).  
   Additionally, you can use the CLI [token commands](https://ext.approov.io/docs/latest/approov-cli-tool-reference/#token-commands) to validate tokens, generate new ones, and set the data hash.

2. **Token Attachment:**  
   The app attaches this token to every API request using the `Approov-Token` HTTP header.

3. **Server Validation:**  
   The [server verifies](https://ext.approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#approov-architecture) the token using the shared Approov secret, checking its:
    - Signature authenticity
    - Expiration (`exp` claim)
    - Other claims if configured

4. **Token Binding (Optional):**  
   [Token binding](https://ext.approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#token-binding) is configured by the app via the Approov SDK, which hashes a chosen binding value (for example the `Authorization` header) and embeds it into the Approov token.  
   The protected API then computes the same hash from the incoming request and verifies that it matches the `pay` claim, preventing token reuse or replay attacks. For local testing, you can also generate example tokens with a binding using the Approov CLI.

5. **Request Decision:**   
      If all checks pass → the request is trusted and processed `200 OK`.   
      If validation fails → the server responds with `401 Unauthorized`.

## Requirements:

1. ***Approov account*** - If you're new, sign up for an [Approov trial account](https://approov.io/signup).
2. ***Approov CLI initialized*** - Follow the [installation guide](https://ext.approov.io/docs/latest/approov-installation/#initializing-the-approov-cli) and confirm `approov whoami` works.
3. ***Install curl*** - Ensure the `curl` CLI is available.
4. ***Create .env file*** - copy `.env.example` so there is a place to store the secret key.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

5. ***Configure secret*** - fetch the secret and add it to `.env` (`APPROOV_BASE64URL_SECRET`):
   ```bash
   approov secret -get base64url
   ```

6. ***Register API domain*** - point Approov at your backend API (default example.com):
   ```bash
   approov api -add example.com
   ```

7. ***Install Docker and Docker Compose*** - follow the official guide: [Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

## Try it yourself using Docker

*If you have all requirements, you can run*

```bash
bash run-server.sh
```

This script:
- Builds and starts the container via `scripts/build.sh` (`docker build` + `docker run`) and waits for `/approov-state` to be ready.

*Once finished, press `Ctrl+C` to stop log tailing; the container keeps running unless you stop it. Use `docker ps` to find the container name and `docker stop <container_name>` to stop it.*

### Automated and Manual Testing

*When the server is running (in a different terminal), validate the endpoints via the automated bash script or by running the manual checks below*

```bash
bash test.sh
```

This script:
- Verifies that the `approov` and `curl` commands are installed.
- Checks Approov status by calling `/approov-state` (enabled vs disabled).
- Runs endpoint tests against `/unprotected` (no token), `/token-check` (valid/invalid Approov tokens), `/token-binding` (token bound to `Authorization`), and `/token-double-binding` (token bound to `Authorization` + `Content-Digest`).
- Logs full request/response details to `.config/logs/<timestamp>.log`.

#### *1. Unprotected Endpoint (No Approov)*

- The client sends a normal HTTP request.
- The server **does not verify** any Approov token or extra authentication header.
- This means **any client** (even tampered or unauthorized) can call the API if they know the URL.

*The following example shows how the API responds when no Approov protection is applied.*

```bash
curl -iX GET http://localhost:8080/unprotected
```

The response will be `200 OK` for this request:
```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-cache
```

#### *2. Approov Token Check*

- The client includes an `Approov-Token` (a short-lived JWT) in each API request header.
- The server verifies this token using the **Approov secret key** that is securely configured on the backend and checks:
    -  Token verification - confirms the token is signed by the Approov secret.
    -  Expiration (`exp` claim) - ensures the token is still valid.
- If the token is valid → request is trusted.
- If invalid → server returns `401 Unauthorized`.
- **Purpose**: Protect API endpoints so that only authentic, unmodified Approov-integrated apps can access them.

***The following example shows how the API responds when an Approov token is required.***

*Generate a valid Approov token:*

```bash
approov token -genExample example.com
```

*Use the generated token in the `Approov-Token` header and `/token-check` endpoint.*

```bash
curl -iX GET http://localhost:8080/token-check \
     -H "Approov-Token: valid_approov_token_here"
```

The response will be `200 OK` for this request:

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-cache
```

*If you use an invalid or missing token, the server will respond with `401 Unauthorized`.*

#### *3. Approov Token Binding Check*

- The client sends two headers on authenticated API calls:
    - `Approov-Token`
    - `Authorization` – your auth token value (e.g., `ExampleAuthToken==`)
- The server verifies the token and ensures that the bound value matches what the app used.
- Prevents token replay - the Approov token cannot be reused or stolen for another session.
- **Use case:** Stronger protection for authenticated API calls tied to a specific user or device.

***The following example shows how the API responds when an Approov token with binding is required.***

*Generate a valid Approov token bound to the `Authorization` header:*

```bash
approov token -setDataHashInToken ExampleAuthToken== -genExample example.com
```

*Use the generated token with binding in the Approov-Token and Authorization headers when calling the /token-binding endpoint.*

```bash
curl -iX GET http://localhost:8080/token-binding \
     -H "Approov-Token: valid_approov_token_here" \
     -H "Authorization: ExampleAuthToken=="
```

The response will be `200 OK` for this request:

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-cache
```

*If you use an invalid or missing header or token, the server will respond with `401 Unauthorized`.*

#### Approov Token Binding Check with Two Different Bound Values

- The client sends three headers on authenticated API calls:
    - `Approov-Token`
    - `Authorization`
    - `Content-Digest` It is combined with the `Authorization` header to create a stronger binding.
- Both are included in the hash inside the Approov token. This means the server verifies a single hash that covers both authentication credentials.
- **Use case:** Stronger protection then single binding by tying both headers together.

***The following example shows how the API responds when an Approov token with two bindings is required.***

*Generate a valid Approov token bound to the `Authorization` and `Content-Digest` headers:*

```bash
approov token -setDataHashInToken ExampleAuthToken==ContentDigest== -genExample example.com
```

*Use the generated token with two bindings in the Approov-Token and Authorization headers when calling the `/token-double-binding` endpoint.*

```bash
curl -iX GET http://localhost:8080/token-double-binding \
     -H "Approov-Token: valid_approov_token_here" \
     -H "Authorization: ExampleAuthToken==" \
     -H "Content-Digest: ContentDigest=="
```

The response will be `200 OK` for this request.

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-cache
```

*If you use an invalid or missing header or token, the server will respond with `401 Unauthorized`.*

## Enable or Disable Approov Protection      

When the example server is running on `localhost:8080`, you can toggle Approov protection with these commands:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/approov/disable    # disable the Approov service

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/approov/enable     # enable the Approov service

curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/approov-state       # check current state
```

*You can rerun the tests with Approov disabled to observe how the application behaves when the Approov protection is ***no longer active***.*
